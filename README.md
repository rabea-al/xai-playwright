# Xircuits Component Library Template

This section should have a short description on what is does.

## Prerequisites

A project may have prerequisites such as models that needs to be downloaded or non-python related setup. You may list them down here.

## Installation

To use this component library, ensure you have Xircuits installed, then simply run:

```
xircuits install https://github.com/your-organization/your-repository
```

Alternatively you may manually copy the directory / clone or submodule the repository to your working Xircuits project directory then install the packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tests
A github action to test your workflow runs has been provided. Simply add the path of your workflows [here](.github/workflows/run-workflow-tests.yml#L11).
